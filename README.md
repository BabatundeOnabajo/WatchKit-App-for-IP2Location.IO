# WatchKit-App-for-IP2Location.IO
This is a WatchKit app designed for the IP2Location.IO services. It enables you to find out information about a given IP address with your Apple Watch, using the API provided by IP2Location.IO. The application shows the many contexts and use cases in which APIs can be used. It is programmed using Swift and uses the latest SwiftUI framework (as opposed to the more traditional, UIKit) and is built on the operating system watchOS 3.

# Requirements
In order to use this smartwatch app, you will need the following:
* Internet connection
* API key(s) from IP2Location.IO
* Xcode Version 15.0 beta 8 or above (recommended as at September 30th 2023)
* Physical Apple Watch or emulator

It is not necessary to have an iPhone of any kind, as was once the case with previous watchOS systems (in particular, watchOS 1.0).

# Background

# Description of each file in this repository

# Instructions
Playground files are files that run in "Playgrounds", a feature of Xcode that enables you to quickly execute code without the need to run or compile a full-built app or project. Playgrounds are extremely helpful when wanting to see the effect of a particular line(s) of code. They are particularly relevant here as IP2Location.IO does not feature Swift in their examples.
